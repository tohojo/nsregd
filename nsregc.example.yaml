# Whether to try to auto-discover a zone to register with. This is done by
# querying for PTR records in the record names defined for DNS-SD in RFC6763.
# These records take the form r._dns-sd._udp.<domain> where <domain> is either
# "local.", ".home.arpa" or one of the reverse lookup domains derived from the
# IP addresses found on the configured interfaces.
#
# If enabled, registration will be attempted in all zones discovered through
# this mechanism *in addition* to the manually specified zones above (or on the
# command line).

# Interfaces to get addresses from. A separate record is created for each
# address found on each of these interfaces (subject to filtering below). The
# kernel-reported TTL for each address will be used if it is less than the
# addr-ttl configured above.
#
# If unset, all addresses found on the system will be used.
#interfaces:
#  - eth0

# Subnets that are excluded from registration. Any address found in one of these
# subnets will be ignored when registering. If unset, will default to excluding
# localhost and link-local addresses.
